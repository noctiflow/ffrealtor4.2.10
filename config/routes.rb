  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
  get 'landing/buy1', to: 'landing#buy1'
  get 'landing/buy2', to: 'landing#buy2'
  get 'landing/sell1', to: 'landing#sell1'
  get 'landing/sell2', to: 'landing#sell2'
  post 'landing', action: :create1, controller: 'landing'
  post 'landing2', action: :create2, controller: 'landing'
  post 'landing3', action: :create3, controller: 'landing'
  post 'landing4', action: :create4, controller: 'landing'
  get 'landing', to: 'landing#index'
  get 'landing2', to: 'landing#index2'
  get 'landing3', to: 'landing#index3'
  get 'landing4', to: 'landing#index4'
  get '/redirect', to: 'calendar#redirect', as: 'redirect'
  get '/callback', to: 'calendar#callback', as: 'callback'
  get '/calendars', to: 'calendar#calendars', as: 'calendars'
  get '/events/:calendar_id', to: 'calendar#events', as: 'events', calendar_id: /[^\/]+/
